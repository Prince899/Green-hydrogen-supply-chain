# Green Hydrogen Supply Chain Optimization for Steel Industry

This project presents a large-scale MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) model to optimize the supply chain of green hydrogen from renewable sources to major Indian steel plants.

##  Problem Statement
The steel sector is a major emitter of CO₂ in India. This model optimizes the sizing and routing of green hydrogen (produced via solar and wind) from ports to plants using truck-based delivery, while minimizing total cost and emissions.

##  Model Highlights
- Demand zones: JSW (Vijaynagar), JSPL (Angul), SAIL (Rourkela), TATA (Jamshedpur)
- Supply zones: Paradip, Kandla, Tuticorin
- Constraints: renewable generation limits, truck fleet, hourly demand, emission thresholds
- Output: optimized production, transport plan, cost & emission analysis

##  Tools Used
- Python   
- Gurobi  

##  Key Results
- Emissions per tonne of steel: < 1.6 tCO₂ (green steel threshold)
- Cost savings up to $6B by relaxing power constraints
- Transport cost: $3.46–$7.58/kg H₂ depending on power availability
